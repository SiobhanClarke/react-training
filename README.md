Navigate in to project workspace to clone this repository

```
git clone git@scm.server.traveljigsaw.com:tech-returners/react-training.git

Install the dependencies for the react playground and run the playground. Please note that `npm run init` is a custom script that installs all the dependencies required by React in the `playground` directory.

```
npm run init
npm run playground
```

You should see a webpage open in your default browser on http://localhost:3000/ like this

- Run the following command in the terminal `npm run playground` and you should see your React application open in http://localhost:3000/
